# sdl-wasm [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple example of compiling C/SDL to WebAssembly and binding it to an HTML5 canvas. 

Live demo: https://shlomnissan.github.io/sdl-wasm

## Installation:

1. Install Emscripten:<br/>
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

2. Clone the repository:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/shlomnissan/sdl-wasm`<br/>
`cd sdl-wasm`

3. Run `make` or build manually:<br/>
`emcc main.c -s WASM=1 -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS='["png"]' --preload-file assets -o index.js`

4. Chrome doesn't support file XHR requests so you need to open index.html from a web server. You can use Emscripten for that too: 
`emrun index.html`

5. ðŸ•¹Use the arrow keys to move the texture around.

## Todos:

- [x] Add keyboard input controls to move the square around
- [x] Include SDL_Image and render a texture instead of the blue square
